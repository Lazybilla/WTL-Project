          Tao Art Gallery has been an able guide, illuminating the way to art for fourteen years now; the gallery was established on the 28th January 2000. Exhibition space is divided into 2 galleries,  owned by self-taught artist, curator, connoisseur, collector and philanthropist, Kalpana Shah.

          Tao has curated uniquely conceptualized shows highlighting diverse art forms like painting, photography, sculpture, video, performance as well as installation arts. It showcases works of Contemporary masters as well as emerging and mid-career artists.

          The gallery is very open-minded towards any creative expression and emphasizes on powerful and innovative presentation of artistic creativity, building a thought provoking experience for all our viewers and inviting dialogues on culture, aesthetics and tradition of visual arts. This juxtaposition of a wide range of art practice enables us to perform the valuable exercise of providing an enriched experience within various art practices. We use considerable resources at our disposal to promote art.

          Tao has curated international shows at prestigious spaces in London, Tokyo & Singapore for International Institute of Fine Arts (IIFA). Tao has also been actively involved in publishing various art books promoting a range of art forms of Indian artists and organized book release events, interactive sessions with artists, workshops and lectures aim to propagate love for art, and boost the presence of Indian Art in the global arena. Taoâ€™s macro-vision sees art not in isolation, but as having a cohesive relationship with life itself.
